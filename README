To use it put "include Logging"  at the top of the class you want to add
logging to. This adds two new methods:

log_info, log_error

These log just like the logger.info and logger.error methods except
that they prefix the output with "INFO: " and "ERROR: " respectively,
even if the output is multi-line. This means that you can do

% tail -f log/development.log | grep 'INFO'

or

% tail -f log/development.log | grep 'ERROR'

so that you *just* see the logging info in that window uncluttered by
everything else.

Another advantage of this plugin is that you can call the method from
both instance and class methods.
